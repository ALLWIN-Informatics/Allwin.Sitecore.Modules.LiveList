# Allwin.Sitecore.Modules.LiveList

##Purpose of the module

We agreed upon a list  module that can render almost anything, but we didnâ€™t stop there and  added another functionality. To make this list update in real time for the  viewer. 

We chose **SignalR** for the technologyt hat we want to learn and we used  that to make a websocket connection between Sitecore and the browser.  We were trying to make a list that would be versitile enough and could be  used in various situations. So we came to the conclusion that we should be  able to render almost anything into this list. We built this module to be as  general as possible from the ground up. 

We hope that the easy usage and the simple setup will help people set  up this list on their main page and help them keep in thouch with  customers, visitors or passangers.
